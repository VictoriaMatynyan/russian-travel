# Project No.2: [Travel around Russia](https://victoriamatynyan.github.io/russian-travel/)

### Review
**Travel around Russia** is my 2nd project performed during studying at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) as a web developer.  
This project is dedicated to travelling around Russia and throws light on popular (and not very) places to go on holiday or even relocate to.

### Applied decisions in Project No.2:
* HTML5 and CSS3;
* BEM(nested);
* CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* CSS transition;
* hovering elements;
* media queries;  
* adaptive web-design has been realized for the folliwing screen dimensions: 1280px, 1024px, 768px and 320px.
