### Review
This is my 2nd project realized during studying at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) for web-developers.  
The Project No.2 is dedicated to travelling around Russia and throws light on popular and not very places to go on holiday or even relocate to.

### Applied decisions in Project No.2:
* HTML and CSS coding;
* BEM methodology in file structure (nested);
* CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* CSS transition;
* media queries&ast;.  
&ast;Adaptive web-design has been realized for the folliwing screen dimensions: 1280px, 1024px, 768px and 320px.
